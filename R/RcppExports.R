#' Generate matrix of nearest neighbours
#' 
#' Generates a M by n matrix of nearest neighbours. For observations with index less than M,
#' only i-1 nearest neighbours are generated.
#' 
#' @param x Matrix with x and y coordinates of the observations
#' @param M Number of nearest neighbours
#' @return A M by n matrix of nearest neighbours. Note the indexing of the observations returned
#' by this function starts at zero.
