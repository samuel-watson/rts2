# rts2

There are a wide variety of sources of case data that are finely spatially-resolved and time stamped to monitor disease epidemiology in real-time. 
These data may include daily hospital admissions, positive tests, or calls to public health telephone services. Geospatial statistical models provide a 
principled basis for generating predictions of disease epidemiology and its spatial and temporal distribution from these data. 
`rts2` provides a set of functions to conduct disease surveillance using a real-time feed of spatial or spatio-temporal data of cases.
